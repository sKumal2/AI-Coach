# AI-Coach

For this hackathon, so ok, I have decided to do project on ai coach assistant (basically what it does is team tactics and team formation for coach siggestion and everything related to team on what player to choose and eveything ) ( for now we are just trying to do argentina and france ) ( for world cup 2026 ) ( basically getting data from 5 previous recent matches of both team ) ( and coach can use ai to form tactics of team ) ( will have all player characteristics like player attributes, shots, accuarcy, and eveything ) ( should see this as a player ) ( and also who is playing from what position in oppenenet field ) ( coach should get an idea of how to send as a player or what position that should play from ) ( basically thats it reading data from previous matches data ) ( I need general overview of what should i do and what should i use for this and how and also coding. Thanks. ( focus on live coach assistant ) )
